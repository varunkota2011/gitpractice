What is a lambda function in Python?,"It is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword that can have any number of arguments but only one expression."
What is the general syntax for a Python lambda function?,The syntax is `lambda arguments: expression`.
A key limitation of lambda functions is that they can have any number of arguments but only _____ expression.,one
Why are lambda functions also known as anonymous functions?,"Because they are defined without a name, unless they are assigned to a variable."
How is the result of a lambda function's expression returned?,"The expression is evaluated and its result is returned implicitly, without needing an explicit `return` keyword."
What is a primary difference between a `def` function and a `lambda` function regarding statements?,"A `def` function can contain multiple statements and expressions, while a `lambda` function is restricted to a single expression."
"What programming paradigm treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments and returned from other functions?",Functional programming.
"In functional programming, what does it mean for functions to be 'first-class citizens'?","It means they can be bound to names, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just like any other data type."
When is it generally considered bad practice to use a lambda function?,"When the logic is complex, requiring multiple statements, loops, or conditional blocks that would be clearer in a regular `def` function."
What should you do if you find yourself using the same lambda expression in multiple places?,Convert it to a named function using `def` to improve maintainability and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
How can using a lambda function impact debugging?,"They can be challenging to debug because they appear as `<lambda>` in stack traces, making error messages less clear."
What is a more 'Pythonic' alternative to using `map()` with a lambda function for simple transformations?,"A list comprehension, such as `[x**2 for x in numbers]`."
What is a more 'Pythonic' alternative to using `filter()` with a lambda function?,"A list comprehension with a conditional clause, such as `[x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]`."
What is the purpose of the built-in `map()` function in Python?,It applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns a map object (an iterator) with the results.
What is the syntax for the `map()` function?,"The syntax is `map(function, iterable)`."
"Code: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`
`list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))`
What is the output?","The output is `[2, 4, 6]`."
What is the purpose of the built-in `filter()` function in Python?,It constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.
What is the syntax for the `filter()` function?,"The syntax is `filter(function, iterable)`."
"Code: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
`list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))`
What is the output?","The output is `[2, 4]`."
From which module must the `reduce()` function be imported in Python?,It must be imported from the `functools` module.
How does the `reduce()` function work?,"It applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value."
"Code: `from functools import reduce`
`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
`reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)`
What is the output?",The output is `10`.
Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results are known as _____ functions.,higher-order
"Why are `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()` considered higher-order functions?","Because they accept another function as one of their arguments (e.g., the transformation function for `map` or the `key` function for `sorted`)."
"When sorting a list of dictionaries, how can a lambda function be used with the `sorted()` function?",It can be passed as the `key` argument to specify which dictionary value to use for the comparison.
"Code: `students = [{'name': 'Bob', 'score': 80}, {'name': 'Alice', 'score': 90}]`
`sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['score'])`
What is the output?","The output is `[{'name': 'Bob', 'score': 80}, {'name': 'Alice', 'score': 90}]`."
How would you sort a list of dictionaries by `age` and then by `name` if the ages are the same?,"By providing a tuple in the lambda key: `sorted(dic, key=lambda x: (x['age'], x['name']))`."
"While assigning a lambda to a variable is possible (e.g., `add = lambda x, y: x + y`), why is it often discouraged?","It is often better to define a regular function with `def` for clarity, readability, and better debugging information."
What is the 'late binding closure trap' often encountered when creating lambdas in a loop?,"All created lambdas will refer to the final value of the loop variable, not the value it had when the lambda was created."
"Code: `funcs = [lambda: print(i) for i in range(3)]`
`for f in funcs: f()`
What is the output and why?","The output is `2`, `2`, `2`, because `i` is looked up when the functions are called, by which time the loop has finished and `i` is 2."
How can you solve the 'late binding closure trap' when creating lambdas in a loop?,"By using a default argument to capture the loop variable's value at definition time, like `lambda i=i: print(i)`."
A function that has no side effects (like modifying a global variable or performing I/O) and always returns the same result for the same arguments is called a _____ function.,pure
The property that an expression can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior is known as _____.,referential transparency
Why is it generally better to use a `def` function for complex sorting keys instead of a complex lambda?,"A named function improves clarity and readability, making the sorting logic easier to understand."
In what programming context are lambdas useful for defining simple callback functions without cluttering the namespace?,"In event-driven programming, such as GUI applications (e.g., with tkinter)."
"Code: `button = tk.Button(root, text=""Click"", command=lambda: print(""Clicked!""))`
What is the role of the lambda function here?","It serves as a simple, inline callback function that is executed when the button is clicked."
A function that takes a number `n` and returns another function that multiplies its argument by `n` is known as a _____.,function factory
"Code: `def make_multiplier(n): return lambda x: x * n`
What does `make_multiplier(3)` return?",It returns a lambda function that takes one argument `x` and returns `x * 3`.
Can a lambda function contain conditional logic?,"Yes, but only in the form of a single conditional expression (ternary operator), such as `x if x > y else y`."
How do you provide a default value for a parameter in a lambda function?,"In the same way as a regular function, for example: `lambda x, y=1: x / y`."
What is the performance difference between a lambda function and an equivalent regular function?,"The performance difference is typically negligible, so the choice should be based on readability and maintainability."
"What does a lambda function return if it is printed without being called, as in `print(lambda x: x)`?","It returns the function object itself, showing its type and memory address."
"In Pandas, which method is used with a lambda function to apply an operation to every element in a Series?",The `.apply()` method.
"Code: `df['name'].apply(lambda x: x.lower())`
What does this operation do?",It converts every string in the 'name' column of the DataFrame `df` to lowercase.
"Unlike a `def` function, a `lambda` function is a(n) _____ rather than a statement.",expression
"In functional languages, iteration (looping) is usually accomplished via what technique?",Recursion.
"What type of recursion can be optimized by a compiler into the same code used for iteration, avoiding stack space consumption?",Tail recursion.
What does 'strict (eager) evaluation' mean in the context of function arguments?,It means the function arguments are always fully evaluated before the function is called.
What does 'non-strict (lazy) evaluation' mean in the context of function arguments?,It means function arguments are not evaluated unless their values are required to evaluate the function call itself.
